# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Shivani Elitem**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Animalflix** (Netflix, but for animals)

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ü¶Ñ‚úåÔ∏èü•∞**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Pick an app screenshot to duplicate
  - Be sure to add the screenshot to "Chosen Screenshot" below.
- [X] Create a runnable app that displays an Animal Version of your chosen screenshot
- [X] Layout uses one (1) or more ConstraintLayout
- [X] Layout uses one (1) or more ImageView
- [X] Layout uses three (3) or more TextViews

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Create a custom-shape Button using Shape Drawables
- [ ] Customize the text fonts by creating new Font Resources
- [ ] Add Tooltips to your Views to help users understand how to navigate the UI
- [ ] Create a second layout, this time for an original, personal app idea

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you added to improve the app!
 
 I've used basic features, but took the UI Design to the next level!

## Chosen Screenshot

I have chosen to duplicate the following layout from the **Netflix** app:

<img src='https://github.com/ShivaniElitem/Animalflix/blob/master/Netflix.jpg?raw=true' title='Chosen Screenshot' width='' alt='Chosen Screenshot' />

## Demo

Here's a GIF and a Screenshot that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Notes

I've learned a lot of thing this unit. I never knew that a UI Design for a single Constraint Layout would take so long to create. This project was very interesting and I had lots of fun working on it.
